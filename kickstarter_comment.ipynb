As you may or may not know, this is Crooked Kings first venture into the production of anything that isn't playing cards, so it's been a learning process for sure, and I truly appreciate your frustration with the estimated delivery time. We did out best estimating the delivery time, based on what we knew at the time, but obviously we missed the mark a little- but they are indeed coming!\",\n",

Each mold costs around 2k, just for the basic piece, so if we did variations of that piece, each one would cost 2k, and I'm sure you understand just how quickly that would add up. Obviously, we want to get you all an awesome product and we aim to do it in our estimated timeframe, but it's important to remember that it's an estimated timeframe, and no way a hard deadline. In this situation, I felt really strongly that the product could be better, and I'd rather take the heat on the delay, then send you out something that was slightly less then perfect.\",\n",

       "  'I am sorry that we won\\'t be able to offer the larger size without hitting a higher funding amount. In order for us to offer additional sizes we need to be able to hit a larger number of orders to justify the cost of ordering the larger size. We need to be able to order at least 50 units of each size to keep the cost of the toppers to what we are comfortable with selling them at. At 15k we would be able to successfully fund 3 different sizes. At 25k we would comfortably be able to offer more sizes. If we offered more sizes and only made the 15k we wouldn\\'t be able to be profitable and potentially lose money if we couldn\\'t sell the amount of volume that we would be forced to order. We have done extensive research on what to price the products at and what our break even points would be. In the previous kickstarter we had a higher goal and we were able to see the purchasing trends for the larger size and we couldn\\'t justify offering the 48\" wide toppers off the bat. We took the 3 best selling sizes from the previous kickstarter to determine where our starting point should be to create a successful campaign. We love this product and we want to make sure we are in the best possible position to make this project successful.',\n",

Adding the limited deck with a new back is the same thing as ordering 2 separate decks, significantly increasing costs per deck, not only of the limited, but the unlimited as well. The stretch goals were calculated to allow for that price increase as well as to allow for the numbers ordered to rise, thus lowering the production cost... as much as I would love to produce it all, I just can't unless we hit those goals, because I really want to do everything too...

(default is 1.5x) this is as Oculus recommended, since this helps smooth things out.\",\n",

When you are blinking and partially occlusion get the eye the system will continue to try to centre the gaze point based on the reflection of your cornea. So if you eye is open the centre is the centre of your pupil, half blinking the centre of the visible pupil is reduced and therefore looks like an offset. You would typically build in blink compensation to work around this or use a sliding window for gaze point to overcome the blinks by smoothing the data.

Yeah, i agree it might be my head, but if the tracking & update systems are laggy (just watching the tracking app lets me see that there are lots of stutters in between patches of perfect fluidity) makes me realize that it's partly my fault. The other problem is the headset has a different inertia than my head. I wear glasses, so i can't strap it down super tight or my lenses collide with Fove's lenses. I need to get some fresh contacts (or laser surgery...) apparently! So if the headset is still adjusting (mass-inertia-wise) to the most recent movements of my head, that is picked up by the motion tracker and it makes things keep moving (just a little) until all the forces settle.\",\n",

       "  'Sorry for the book but here is your answer :)',\n",
       "  'Hi Andrew,',\n",
       "  'Thank you for your comments and questions. :-D',\n",
       "  'To answer your first question (very long story), the reason that I set the funding level so low is because I just finished a campaign on Indiegogo. Unfortunately I was unable to reach the goal of $3000 that I had set on Indiegogo. Since I set the campaign as flexible funding I managed to get around $1,100 from that campaign **less** Indiegogo Fees and Payment processing fees. I am using that money from Indiegogo to fund the first print run of the cards. And cover all shipping costs for the perks that were claimed from that campaign. Any cards left from that campaign are going to the backers of this campaign.',\n",
       "  'I am expecting to use most of the money for the first print run from Indiegogo. (Which I promised the museum would be only 10 decks of each card). Also, I thought that after all fees were paid to the museum that I would only be able to produce about 10 decks of each cards for the print run.',\n",
       "  'While working with the Museum I had to let them know the amount of my first print run, and get the prices that I am charging pre-approved by the museum before they would approve my request, and grant me exclusive licensing to produce the copyrighted cards.',\n",
       "  'Also I ended up taking out a personal loan to cover the cost of the licensing fees which turned out to be just short of $3000 Canadian Dollars with the conversion to Euros. I was not planning originally to take out the loan, but I ended up putting myself in a situation that I had to take the loan. So I ended up paying the costs upfront to make sure that I could produce these amazing playing cards. I wanted to make them so bad, and offer a piece of history you could actually play with and not just look at.',\n",
       "  'So to finish answering your question (after my long winded explanation), any money raised in this campaign, will; be used in this order: (1) pay for additional print runs for perks claimed (2) Pay for tracked shipping costs for the perks (3) all remaining money will be used to pay off the personal loan I took out.',\n",
       "  'To answer your second question, the decks that I am offering are much smaller than the originals. The originals were printed specially for the KHM Museum. They also come with a professionally bound book that explains the history of the playing cards. Mine cards will not come with the professionally bound book that the museum offers.',\n",
       "  'My cards will be printed on a modern day 300gsm, smooth card stock; unlike the Piatnik version, which is printed on a smooth coated card stock. Any gold gilding on the cards, is done with gold ink, where as mine will only have a printed gold coloring. Also the cards offered by Piatnik also are called facsimile editions; facsimile editions are an exact copy of the ones in the museums possession. Any parts of the missing paper, or tears in the cards, as well as the original size of the cards will be in the facsimile edition. My cards are NOT going to feature the tears, and missing sections of the cards. They will show a grey background where the tears and missing sections of paper are.',\n",
       "  'The original cards are around 15 cm tall by about 9 cm wide. The size is far too large to be able to use to play every day card games with. Trust me I tried to use them that way (out of curiosity). My cards are a poker sized which are 3 inches tall by 2.5 inches wide. The card stock is different from the one offered in the Piatnik Edition. The packaging is also different. The Hunting deck comes in a cloth covered cardboard box, and the Court Deck comes in a standard cardboard box from the Museum. The museum boxes only feature one card on the box. My boxes will feature a card from each suit. Also the packaging I am offering is a tin box rather than cardboard.',\n",
       "  'I am doing as much as I can to differentiate my product from what the museum offers. I also promised the museum that these cards would not be collector’s editions. But being a historical games company, I do my best to offer historically accurate board games, playing cards, dice from the many different time periods. The playing cards I am moving to modern day playing card stock, as more people tend to like the cards on modern day playing card stock. Though I do plan to offer special order ones on uncoated playing card stock for the people who want them for living history re-enactments.',\n",

       "  'Second, you say \"Once again these cards are NOT going to be collector’s cards, they are meant for everyday use. If you want the collector’s editions you can purchase them directly from the KHM website. The collector’s editions are the version that Piatnik made for the KHM Museum.\"',\n",

For the curious, there was good packaging and, as a result, almost no shipping damage (a small ding in the board edge where the tab that holds it in place seems to have been pushed into it too hard). Shipping box/etc. held up despite being left in the yard in the rain (in a bag) by the Postal Service.',\n",
       "  \"3. One pun-intended mixed bag: I love the token bag, and it's of great, great quality with a very nice stitched logo. But it's ENORMOUS for the job (holding eight small tokens) and barely fits into the component slot, and the only way all the components fit is if I stuff everything (the crown, etc.) inside the bag.\",\n",
       "  '4. The crown is so fun and, like everything else, well-made so it held up in shipping, and the tokens are adorable. I have two little girls who are going to be fighting over all of this stuff, so I guess my praise of the quality will be put to the test!',\n",
       "  \"5. One small disappointment, by way of constructive criticism: The center sticker doesn't line up with the card slots properly, in part because the various labels aren't the same size, and there are a couple of extra card slots in the plastic insert, unless I'm doing something wrong. It's a good idea, just shaky on the QC.\",\n",
       "  '6. One larger disappointment: I\\'m not enamored of the acrylic coin (which I nearly didn\\'t find, as it was wrapped in brown paper in the shipping box, separate from the game itself, the only component that wasn\\'t inside other than the mat). The quality is not that great, with some roughness on the edges and clouding to the acrylic, with the artwork insert seam obvious and the \"halves\" nowhere near even (one is slightly concave). IMHO, for an add-on I paid $15 for, it wasn\\'t worth it. On the other hand, part of my disappointment stems from the fact that the wooden token it\\'s meant to replace is both larger (the better to show the beautiful art) and feels nicer.',\n",

Or does the mini's base determine the footprint on the map, making such movement through a single point impossible?\",\n",
